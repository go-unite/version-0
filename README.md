# Go Unite

We are building a platform where Nonprofits, Community Organizers, Volunteers, and everyone in between can share their instructions for how they get things done and their feedback on those instructions. By creating a sort of “how-to hub” of humanitarian work we can find patterns, inefficiencies, and better ways of coordinating our collective - but sometimes conflicting - social impact work.

Please check out the following things before digging into this projects:

- Coming soon: Intro Episode of the Podcast (you could also check out the rough draft versions of our first series [here](patreon.com/gounite) if you’d like)

## The App

This project is our first (official) attempt at our cross-platform app. We try to be as modular as we can be wherever possible, and here that means *stages*:
1. This prototype
    1. Backend setup
    2. Basic user stats
    3. Interfaces for: creating, editing (your own), and viewing (others') templates
2. Alpha
    1. Workflow for testing templates
    2. Building out features of user accounts
    3. Testing of live event functionality
    4. Building out a marketplace features 
3. Beta
    1. Role Assignment Workflow
    2. Work Verification Workflow
    3. Community Testing of app (???)
4. TBA...

For now, the project is a [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) app using [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for hosting, authenitication and database management. And we're all ears!


**If you aren’t totally sure you know where you are and what this is,** but are interested in learning more about coding and working on this or things like it: see if [Code for America](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/) has anything going on in your area. There are lots of good places online to start learning the basics, and lots of opportunities with this project for any who are interested.

**Getting to Work**
We're working on getting our projects and issues set up for y'all to contribute in a more streamlined way currently. For now you can join our Discord and let's talk ideas. (It's pretty much just Ian trying his best).
<!-- Head over to the [projects tab](https://github.com/go-unite/prototype/projects) and see if anything sounds interesting to work on. These are meant to be tasks for a group to work through over time. Or if you’re in a more of a problem solving mood, grab an [issue](https://github.com/go-unite/prototype/issues) and have at it. -->

<!-- **Edits** -->
<!-- For small things, PLEASE go ahead and make a pull request. For anything else, have a look through the [issues](https://github.com/go-unite/prototype/issues), and if you don’t think your contribution is already being discussed feel free to [create a new one](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue). -->
