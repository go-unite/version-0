# Go Unite

We are building a platform where Nonprofits, Community Organizers, Volunteers, and everyone in between can share their instructions for how they get things done and their feedback on those instructions. By creating a sort of “how-to hub” of humanitarian work we can find patterns, inefficiencies, and better ways of coordinating our collective - but sometimes conflicting - social impact work.

Please check out the following things before digging into this projects:

## The App

This project is our first (official) attempt at our cross-platform app. We try to be as modular as we can be wherever possible, and here that means *stages*:
1. This prototype
    1. Backend setup
    2. Interfaces for: creating, editing, and viewing templates
2. Alpha
    1. Workflow for testing templates
    2. Building out features of user accounts
3. Beta
    1. Template Assignment Workflow
    2. Verification Workflow
    3. Community Testing
4. TBA...

For now, the project is a [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) app using [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for hosting, authenitication and database management. And we're all ears!
  

**If you aren’t totally sure you know where you are and what this is,** but are interested in learning more about coding and working on this or things like it: see if [Code for America](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/) has anything going on in your area. There are lots of good places online to start learning the basics, and lots of opportunities with this project for any who are interested.
